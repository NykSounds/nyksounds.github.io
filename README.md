# Nyksounds
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description:
I remember a time when I began making music and it was very much a lonely vocation. I sat in my room and played with a number of instruments and software. It was only later that I understood that the quality of the sounds I was creating was heavily dependent on the sample packs I owned. Sadly, a lot of the alternatives that would be available on the market were either too much or did not have the originality and flair I needed.

Thatâ€™s when I got the idea of making a website where people would upload their original samples in order to share them with other musicians. I imagined a place where ideas could take root and blossom, where resources would not be driven by the pursuit of profit.

I started out by sketching the functional features that I personally wanted to be included. I wanted this platform to be user-friendly because I wanted musicians from all walks of life to be able to use it. I also wanted to make sure that the platform is designed in such a way that there are no hurdles in community building and maintenance.

So, I started tinkering with HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP for the website. I selected Arch Linux along with (neo)vim for the development purposes as they were known to me and I knew they would be quite effective.
