#### Description:
When I first started making music, I was a solitary figure in my bedroom, experimenting with various instruments and software. I quickly realized that the quality of my sounds was heavily dependent on the sample packs I had access to. Unfortunately, many of the commercially available options were either overpriced or lacked the authenticity and creativity I was looking for.

That's when I had the idea to create a platform where musicians could share their original sample packs with each other. I envisioned a space where creativity and collaboration could flourish, free from the constraints of profit-driven motives.
I'm considering adding features like integration with popular digital audio workstations (DAWs), educational resources, and a mobile app. I'm also interested in exploring ways to further enhance the community features and foster even more collaboration.

Ultimately, I want the platform to remain a valuable resource for musicians of all levels. I believe that by providing a free and open-source platform for sharing sample packs, we can help to democratize music production and make it more accessible to everyone.

**TODO**
- [ ] Add a dark mode
